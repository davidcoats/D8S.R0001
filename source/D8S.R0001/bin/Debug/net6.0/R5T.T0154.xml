            Attribute indicating a type is a draft Razor component.
            Draft Razor component types are quickly created functionality that should be reviewed and relocated, and thus full become Razor component types.
            It's usually pretty clear that something is a Razor component, but the marker attribute is useful for surveying assemblies and code, then building a catalogue of draft Razor components as a kind of TODO list.

            <summary>
            Allows specifying that a type is *not* a draft Razor component type.
            This is useful for marking types that end up canonical draft Razor component code file locations, but are not actually draft Razor components.
