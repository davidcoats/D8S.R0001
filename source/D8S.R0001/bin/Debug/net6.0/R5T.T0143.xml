            <summary>
            Marks an attribute as being a draft marker attribute. (Used for marking attributes as marker attributes. Draft marker attributes are quickly created marker attributes that should be reviewed and relocated, and thus become marker attributes.)
            The marker attribute is useful for surveying assemblies and code, then building a catalogue of draft marker attributes as a kind of TODO list.

        <member name="P:R5T.T0143.DraftMarkerAttributeMarkerAttribute.IsMarkerAttribute">
            <summary>
            Allows specifying that a type is *not* a marker attribute.
            This is useful for marking types that end up canonical marker attribute code file locations, but are not actually marker attributes.

            <summary>
            Marker interface for types that are draft marker attributes.
            Allows methods-for, and extension methods-on, all types that are draft marker attributes.
            Note: while it might be rare to actually see an instance of an attribute type, this interface is provided for consistency.
